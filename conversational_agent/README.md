#Conversational Agent
Building a Conversational Agent with Context Awareness

Overview:
This project outlines the process of creating a conversational agent that maintains context across multiple interactions. We'll use a modern AI framework to build an agent capable of engaging in more natural and coherent conversations.

Motivation:
Many simple chatbots lack the ability to maintain context, leading to disjointed and frustrating user experiences. This project aims to solve that problem by implementing a conversational agent that can remember and refer to previous parts of the conversation, enhancing the overall interaction quality.

Key Components:
Language Model: The core AI component that generates responses.
Prompt Template: Defines the structure of our conversations.
History Manager: Manages conversation history and context.
Message Store: Stores the messages for each conversation session.

Method Details:
Setting Up the Environment
I'll Begin by setting up the necessary AI framework and ensuring access to a suitable language model. This forms the foundation of our conversational agent.

Creating the Chat History Store:
Implement a system to manage multiple conversation sessions. Each session should be uniquely identifiable and associated with its own message history.

Defining the Conversation Structure
Create a template that includes:

A system message defining the AI's role
A placeholder for conversation history
The user's input
This structure guides the AI's responses and maintains consistency throughout the conversation.

Building the Conversational Chain:
Combine the prompt template with the language model to create a basic conversational chain. Wrap this chain with a history management component that automatically handles the insertion and retrieval of conversation history.

Interacting with the Agent:
To use the agent, invoke it with a user input and a session identifier. The history manager takes care of retrieving the appropriate conversation history, inserting it into the prompt, and storing new messages after each interaction.

Conclusion:
This approach to creating a conversational agent offers several advantages:

Context Awareness: The agent can refer to previous parts of the conversation, leading to more natural interactions.
Simplicity: The modular design keeps the implementation straightforward.
Flexibility: It's easy to modify the conversation structure or switch to a different language model.
Scalability: The session-based approach allows for managing multiple independent conversations.
